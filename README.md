# Google Cloud Storage Chef Cookbook

This cookbook provides the built-in types and services for Chef to manage
Google Cloud Storage resources, as native Chef types.

## Requirements

### Platforms

#### Supported Operating Systems

This cookbook was tested on the following operating systems:

* RedHat 6, 7
* CentOS 6, 7
* Debian 7, 8
* Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 16.04, 16.10
* SLES 11-sp4, 12-sp2
* openSUSE 13
* Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2, 2012 R2 Core, 2016 R2, 2016 R2 Core

## Example

```ruby
gauth_credential 'mycred' do
  action :serviceaccount
  path ENV['CRED_PATH'] # e.g. '/path/to/my_account.json'
  scopes [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control'
  ]
end

gstorage_bucket 'storage-bucket' do
  action :create
  project 'google.com:graphite-playground'
  credential 'mycred'
end
```

## Credentials

All Google Cloud Platform cookbooks use an unified authentication mechanism,
provided by the `google-gauth` cookbook. Don't worry, it is automatically
installed when you install this module.

### Example

```ruby
gauth_credential 'mycred' do
  action :serviceaccount
  path ENV['CRED_PATH'] # e.g. '/path/to/my_account.json'
  scopes [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control'
  ]
end

```

For complete details of the authentication cookbook, visit the
[google-gauth][] cookbook documentation.

## Resources

* [`gstorage_bucket`](#gstorage_bucket) -
    The Buckets resource represents a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. There
    is
    a single global namespace shared by all buckets. For more information,
    see
    Bucket Name Requirements.
    Buckets contain objects which can be accessed by their own methods. In
    addition to the acl property, buckets contain bucketAccessControls, for
    use in fine-grained manipulation of an existing bucket's access
    controls.
    A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group.
* [`gstorage_bucket_access_control`](#gstorage_bucket_access_control) -
    The BucketAccessControls resource represents the Access Control Lists
    (ACLs) for buckets within Google Cloud Storage. ACLs let you specify
    who
    has access to your data and to what extent.
    There are three roles that can be assigned to an entity:
    READERs can get the bucket, though no acl property will be returned,
    and
    list the bucket's objects.  WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert
    objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects.  OWNERs are
    WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a
    bucket,
    and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket.  For more
    information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses
    READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL.


### gstorage_bucket
The Buckets resource represents a bucket in Google Cloud Storage. There is
a single global namespace shared by all buckets. For more information, see
Bucket Name Requirements.

Buckets contain objects which can be accessed by their own methods. In
addition to the acl property, buckets contain bucketAccessControls, for
use in fine-grained manipulation of an existing bucket's access controls.

A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group.


#### Example

```ruby
# This is a simple example of a bucket creation/ensure existence. If you want a
# more thorough setup of its ACL please refer to 'examples/bucket~acl.pp'
# manifest.
gstorage_bucket 'storage-module-test' do
  action :create
  project 'google.com:graphite-playground'
  credential 'mycred'
end

```

#### Actions

* `create` -
  Converges the `gstorage_bucket` resource into the final
  state described within the block. If the resource does not exist, Chef will
  attempt to create it.
* `delete` -
  Ensures the `gstorage_bucket` resource is not present.
  If the resource already exists Chef will attempt to delete it.

#### Properties

  this condition is satisfied when there are at least N
  versions (including the live version) newer than this
  version of the object.

  specified for a newly-created object. This defines how objects in the
  bucket are stored and determines the SLA and the cost of storage.
  Values include MULTI_REGIONAL, REGIONAL, STANDARD, NEARLINE, COLDLINE,
  and DURABLE_REDUCED_AVAILABILITY. If this value is not specified when
  the bucket is created, it will default to STANDARD. For more

* `versioning/enabled`
  While set to true, versioning is fully enabled for this bucket.

  The bucket's website configuration, controlling how the service
  behaves when accessing bucket contents as a web site. See the Static
  Website Examples for more information.

* `website/main_page_suffix`
  If the requested object path is missing, the service will ensure
  the path has a trailing '/', append this suffix, and attempt to
  retrieve the resulting object. This allows the creation of
  index.html objects to represent directory pages.

* `website/not_found_page`
  If the requested object path is missing, and any mainPageSuffix
  object is missing, if applicable, the service will return the
  named object from this bucket as the content for a 404 Not Found
  result.

* `project` -
  A valid API project identifier.

* `predefined_default_object_acl` -
  Apply a predefined set of default object access controls to this
  bucket.

  allAuthenticatedUsers get READER access.
  - "bucketOwnerFullControl": Object owner gets OWNER access, and
  project team owners get OWNER access.
  - "bucketOwnerRead": Object owner gets OWNER access, and project
  team owners get READER access.
  - "private": Object owner gets OWNER access.
  - "projectPrivate": Object owner gets OWNER access, and project team
  members get access according to their roles.
  - "publicRead": Object owner gets OWNER access, and allUsers get
  READER access.

#### Label
Set the `b_label` property when attempting to set primary key
of this object. The primary key will always be referred to by the initials of
the resource followed by "_label"

### gstorage_bucket_access_control
The BucketAccessControls resource represents the Access Control Lists
(ACLs) for buckets within Google Cloud Storage. ACLs let you specify who
has access to your data and to what extent.

There are three roles that can be assigned to an entity:

READERs can get the bucket, though no acl property will be returned, and
list the bucket's objects.  WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert
objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects.  OWNERs are
WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a bucket,
and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket.  For more
information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses
READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL.


#### Example

```ruby
# Bucket Access Control requires a bucket. Please ensure its existence with
# the gstorage_bucket { ... } resource
gstorage_bucket_access_control 'user-nelsona@google.com' do
  action :create
  bucket 'storage-module-test'
  entity 'user-nelsona@google.com'
  role 'WRITER'
  project 'google.com:graphite-playground'
  credential 'mycred'
end

```

  entity_id    string
  id           string
  role         'OWNER', 'READER' or 'WRITER'
  project_team {
    team           'editors', 'owners' or 'viewers',
    project_number string,
  }
  project      string
  credential   reference to gauth_credential
